    <p>There are many ways to help people who are discriminated by their skin color; however, one has to be able to first identify colorism when one sees it or experiences it, so answer the following questions. Send us your answers to our email.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. You walk into a store. When you line up to pay, the person in front of you has a lighter skin than you. The cashier is nice and considerate to the person; however, whens it's your turn to pya, the cashier looks at you up and down in disgust and treats way differently than the person in front of you. What is wrong with this situation?</li>
      <li>2. You are babysitting two girls: one has a darker skin than the other one. You see them playing with two different dolls: one doll is also darker than the other doll. The ittle girls are figthing over whih doll each will play with. THe little girl with the darker skin tells her to take the white doll because "it looks like her." What is wrong with what the little girl said? What would you tell them?</li>
      <li>3. It's the last day of senior year in college. You go out with your friends. When you get in, you immediately noticed that all the waitresses are light skinned. You also notice that all the bartenders are light skinned. What is wrong with this?</li>
      <li>4. You are walking out of a grocery store. There at the door is a worker checking the reciepts of the people who had bought stuff. In front of you is a lighter skinned couple. The worker tells the couple to go ahead without checking their reciept. As soon it's your turn the worker tells you, "Excuse me, miss. Please hand over your reciept to make sure you didn't take anything from the store that you didn't pay for." What is wrong with what the worker did?</li>
