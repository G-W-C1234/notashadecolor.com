    <h4>Story #1</h4>
    <p>I don’t think I truly examined the problematic association between skin tone and perceptions of beauty until high school and later college. I heard peers say things like “I have to marry a light skinned man/woman so that my children will be lighter than me”. Those were views rooted in pain they experienced as a child and broadly rooted in systemic colorism. I challenged myself to evaluate my own standard of beauty as a young woman. Maybe I didn’t have any hang ups about my own skin tone but did I harbor views about the beauty of others? I would peruse picture books of black women of different shades, with different features. I would look at the number of times a woman with dark complexion was the punchline to a joke in a film or a sitcom, while the fairer skinned actress was the love interest.  I knew I wasn’t immune to bias and became intent on examining my beliefs and being aware of the bias among my associates and loved ones.  I think in some ways examining how we as a people view each other and how those views are rooted in broader historical and social issues stemming from slavery and institutionalized racism initiated my interest in my current profession (sociologist) and firm belief in cultural self-love. </p>

    <h4>Story #2</h4>
    <p>No matter how desperately I searched to find many beautiful representations of women like myself in magazines, billboards, music videos, and movies, I was overwhelmed by rejection and saturated with ads that endorsed skin-lightening creams.“You're pretty for a dark-skinned girl” was something that I heard often growing up. Unfortunately, due to my low self-esteem and longing for flattery and acceptance, I took this offensive statement as a compliment. I had no idea at the time, that my acceptance of this statement only created an inferiority complex within me. It wasn’t until later that I came to identify statements like this as colorism, a principle that those with lighter skin are treated with a higher regard than those with darker skin. I learned that colorism was not only a problem within the black community, but within Hispanic, Asian, and Middle Eastern communities as well.</p>

    <h4>Story #3</h4>
    <p>One day, back when my life’s greatest thrill was dressing Barbies in those itty bitty little outfits and trying to shove their feet into those teeny tiny little shoes that never fit quite right, my favorite cousin, who was almond-eyed and deep mocha brown, came over to play. She unpacked her pink box of trinkets and thrust a brunette, barely tanned doll in my lap. “This one should be you,” she said. “Her skin looks more like yours.” To me, them was fightin’ words and I was indignant. “But she’s white!” I squabbled, reaching for the clearly Black one I had my sights set on. I ended up getting her—I’m an only child and when I was a kid, I was a classic example that only children are used to getting their own way. As we got older, it became clear that my cousin wanted to be light like me and I wanted to be dark like her. She was Black without question. Mine was always up for interpretation.</p>
